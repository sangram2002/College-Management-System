# College-Management-System

Develop a Python-based College Management System to manage and organize details about students, teachers, and departments in a college. The system should allow users to perform various operations such as adding, deleting, searching, modifying, and printing records for students, teachers, and departments. The data should be stored in a JSON file for persistence.
